          Guiding Acid Soil Management Investments in Africa (GAIA)
        </strong>{" "}
        is a research-for-development project led by the International Maize and
        Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and supported by the Bill and Melinda
        Gates Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project aims to identify and address key knowledge gaps related to
        soil acidity management for sustainable agricultural productivity and
        maintenance of soil health. GAIA is focused on the development of
        scalable innovations to provide reliable, timely and actionable data and
        insights on acidity-related soil health and crop performance, at farm
        and regional levels. The project has undertaken broad-scale analysis for
        all of sub-Saharan Africa, with more focused field and policy-engagement
        activities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regional partners include: the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural
        Research (EIAR), the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research
        Organization (KALRO), the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources
        Development Board (RAB), the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute
        (TARI), the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT).
